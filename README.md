### About Me

Iâ€™m a software engineer and machine learning practitioner who enjoys building scalable, intelligent systems that make a real impact.  
My experience spans automation, distributed infrastructure, and applied AI, with hands-on work developing production grade systems at Viasat and Tejas Networks.

Iâ€™m particularly drawn to projects that sit at the intersection of AI, cloud infrastructure, and software engineering, where systems can learn, adapt, and scale to meet real world challenges.
