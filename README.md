## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer and machine learning practitioner who enjoys building scalable, intelligent systems that make a real impact.  
My work combines AI, cloud infrastructure, and software engineering — creating systems that can **learn, adapt, and scale** to real-world challenges.

I love solving problems where data-driven intelligence meets distributed systems, and I’m always exploring ways to bring ML and automation into production-grade software.
